## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes hospital data for 1,000 patients across 5 hospitals, focusing on key areas such as patient demographics, treatment outcomes, and cost efficiency. The interactive dashboard uncovers actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in healthcare management.

### Key Features

- Visualizes patient admissions, discharges, and treatment outcomes.
- Department-wise and doctor-wise performance tracking.
- Filters and slicers to dynamically view data by time period, gender, treatment type, and more.
- KPI cards for real-time tracking of hospital health indicators.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data source and pre-processing
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom metrics and calculated measures
- **Power Query** – Data transformation and cleaning

## 📁 Data Source

Dummy hospital data was used for this project to simulate a real-world healthcare environment. The dataset was cleaned and modeled using Power Query before dashboard development.

## 💡 Insights Derived

- Identification of overburdened departments with high patient volume.
- Gender and age group distribution of admitted patients.
- Comparison of treatment outcomes across different departments.
- Doctor-wise analysis for operational efficiency.

## 🚀 Improvements Made

- Customized color scheme and layout for better user experience.
- Added additional slicers for gender and treatment types.
- Enhanced performance metrics using optimized DAX calculations.

## 📌 Use Cases

- Hospital administration dashboards
- Clinical operations analysis
- Patient experience and care outcome monitoring
- Healthcare consulting reports
